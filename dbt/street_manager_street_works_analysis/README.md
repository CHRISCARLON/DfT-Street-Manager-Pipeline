# New Feature

DBT integration to automate the creation of analysis tables.

## Folders/files and what they do

- Macros Folder

- Models Folder

- dbt_project.yml

- profiles.yml

- run_dbt_jobs.sh

- **Currently keeping the 'long_term_snaps' directory out of the models folder until I know what I want to do with it. Current report only requires monthly data**
