This repository contains an ETL pipeline for processing DfT Street Manager Open Data. 

Follow the steps below to clone and set up the project.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CHRISCARLON/DfT-Street-Manager-Pipeline.git

cd DfT-Street-Manager-Pipeline
```
This will create a local copy of the repository on your machine.

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install poetry
poetry install
```
Poetry will read the pyproject.toml file and install the required packages into your newly created virtual environment.

### 4. Set Up AWS Secrets Manager
Create an [AWS account]("https://aws.amazon.com") if you don't have one already.
In the AWS Secrets Manager console, create a new secret to store your environment variables. Update the code to retrieve the secrets using the AWS SDK (boto3). 

Alternatively, you can use a different method to manage environment variables, such as a .env file or another secrets management tool.

### 5. Set Up MotherDuck
Sign up for a MotherDuck account at [MotherDuck]("https://motherduck.com").
Obtain the necessary credentials and connection details for your MotherDuck instance - MotherDuck Token, for example.

Update the code to connect to MotherDuck using the provided credentials.

### 6. Run the Pipeline

>[!NOTE]
> For the most recent permit data use "monthly_main.py" for historic data use "historic_main.py".  

```bash
python src/monthly_main.py

or 

python src/historic_main.py
```

This will execute the ETL pipeline to process the DfT Street Manager Open Data and load it into MotherDuck for further processing and/or analytics.
